Utilize New York Times Public API to search articles

LESSON: For quick projects or experiementation, when working with API's and API keys on a client-site application, create a field for the user to enter the API key into and grab the key value through the element when making the API call. This prevents us from exposing a hardcoded API key to the internet when using Git and GitHub.

For server-side or full-stack applications, we can use external libraries and JS modules to hide the API key from users.
